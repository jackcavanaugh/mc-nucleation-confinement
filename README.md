# mc-nucleation-confinement
Monte Carlo simulation to demonstrate the probability distribution of nucleation events over time across an ensemble of independent droplet reactors.

Originally implemented in MATLAB as published in Chemical Science in 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1039/C8SC05634J)

Converted to Python in 2025
